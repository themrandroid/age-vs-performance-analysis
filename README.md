## 💡 Key Findings

- **Age matters**: Students admitted at an older age tend to perform better academically.
- **Policy awareness isn’t enough**: Knowledge of academic policies doesn't directly correlate with better grades — success may depend more on personal preparedness than age or awareness alone.
- This project demonstrates the practical use of **Python-based data analytics** in education research.
